# ZSH

Honestly, not much experience with this shell. I had issues with Fish once and just modified the existing zsh install to
work how I wanted, so here is the zshrc file that came out of that. Copy `./zshrc` to `~/.zshrc`

This is a modified version of the file that came as default with Kali Linux, so I barely know what anything does except
the few lines added in the middle for vim bindings. But, it worked pretty well.
