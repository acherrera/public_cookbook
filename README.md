# Cookbook

Welcome to my notes page! I have lots of info here to share. The intent with this is to show people things that I have
learned, keep track of things that I don't want to keep Googling and have a place where I can share info with others if
they have question.

The repo is broken down into directories, so it should be pretty self-explanatory. RC/config files are kept in
the relevant directory.
